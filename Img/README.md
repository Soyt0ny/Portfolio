# Image Folder

Place your profile image here with the name `yo.jpg`

The image should be:
- Format: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- Recommended size: 400x400px or similar square aspect ratio
- File name: `yo.jpg` (exactly as referenced in the HTML)

## Current Setup
The portfolio references `Img/yo.jpg` in the HTML file. Make sure to:
1. Add your profile photo to this folder
2. Name it exactly `yo.jpg`
3. Ensure it's optimized for web (compressed but good quality)

## Alternative
If you want to use a different image name or format, update the `src` attribute in `portafolio.html`:
```html
<img src="Img/your-image-name.jpg" alt="Profile">
```
